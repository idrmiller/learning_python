## Why Python?
If you check out my other repo's you will notice I have a natural curiosity for many of the popular languages. Honestly it goes a bit deeper than curiosity and many of the languages I study usually apply to an active project I am working on. Currently I am working on a large data analysis project, requiring our team to locate disparate data, clean and normalize the data to some degree, and finally start the analysis. Due to these requirements, I decided to delve deeper into the data science side of the house. 

Earlier this year, I completed the coursera course Data Science Tool Kit. The class provided a great intro to Data Science but the instructors were using the R programming language, which is holding the #1 spot for Data Science professionals, unfortunately the language was not fun to program. 

Upon further research of other programming languages used by Data Scientist, I noticed that many digital driven companies are moving to Python for their data analysis. Additionally, many companies are not only using the data from the analysis, but requiring their data analyst teams to create solutions that can be applied to the production system. In this case, Python has seen a stead increase in usage by Data Scientist.  The few data science courses around have moved to a python curriculum as well. This indicates that the future entrants in the field will be using python. As a product manager, data is our means to validate assumptions, discovery new opportunities, threats, or risk. Therefore the journey on honing my skills and techniques as a PM will require Python. So off we go, to get it done. 

## Programming Foundations in Python -- [Udacity]
* Lessons 1
    * Udacity is very academic its structure. Sometimes, I like it and some times I don't.
    * So far we have created a function that can help a friend our like you, who is working and need to take a break. In short, the program is a break reminder that executes every 2hrs.

## Python -- [Codeacademy]
* Estimated Time Required -- 13hrs
* So, far as of 08/15/15 I completed 4 modules. 
* The language reminds me of Ruby in many ways, with its ease of use and clear flow.
